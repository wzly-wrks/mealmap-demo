// The original Meal Map demo expected a `routes.js` file to set
// `window.routes` with an array of preâ€‘defined route objects. In
// this integration, route data is fetched dynamically from the server
// via `mapbox.js` using the `/api/routes` endpoint. Keeping this
// placeholder prevents a 404 error when the browser requests the
// script but does not contribute any functionality.
